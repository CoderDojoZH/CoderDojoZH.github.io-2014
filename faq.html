            <h3>Is keyboard lava?</h3>
            <p>Yes! To benefit most from the CoderDojo, ninjas should operate their computers by themselves and parents should not touch the keyboard
                during coding.</p>

            <h3>How does a session look like?</h3>
            <p>We start each CoderDojo with an introduction of what we do and who we are and move quickly to programming! There is always a break
                in the middle to catch some breath, get some fresh air and new ideas. About 10-15 minutes before end every ninja has a chance
                to present what they worked on.</p>

            <h3>What do I do during CoderDojo session?</h3>
            <p>If your ninjas is 12 years or younger, you have to stay for the duration of the CoderDojo with us. You can help your child during the first sessions.
                Ninjas really appreciate it. We also have some space for parents. If you have something to do on your computer,
                a book to finish or just want to chat with other parents, you are free to do so.<br/>
                You can also help with a non-programming things during a CoderDojo.</p>

            <h3>How to prepare my ninja/s for CoderDojo?</h3>
            <p>No prior computer or programming knowledge is required.
                Each ninja will need a computer with a keyboard that they can read and a mouse.
                Our youngest ninjas will also need to have flash installed for Lightbot and/or Scratch sessions.
                If you're not sure about it, follow this <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html">link</a>  on the computer you will bring to CoderDojo and press the yellow button.
                We can help you with that at the beginning of CoderDojo session.</p>

            <h3>Do I need to know programming or computers?</h3>
            <p>Not at all! We are happy to help you setup your computer and show how to use it. No prior experience is required. At the very start a browser is enough.</p>

            <h3>What language do I need to speak?</h3>
            <p>Although this page is in English, the tools we use for beginners (lightbot, Scratch) have been translated to many different languages.
                Our mentors speak English, German, Italian and Polish. Also parents that know more languages often help if needed.
                The printed out materials are available in German and English.
                More advanced tools and instructions come in English.
            </p>

            <h3>What are the CoderDojo rules?</h3>
            <p>We have only one rule: Be COOL! If you have any questions, problems, you are stuck or looking for new ideas, just ask other ninjas or
            parents for help. Ok, we have one more rule for parents: keyboard is lava - to make sure that it is you learning programming and not them.</p>

            <h3>How old ninjas can attend CoderDojo?</h3>
            <p>We are open for anyone at the age 7-17. If you are a bit younger, you can also join and see how you like it.</p>

            <h3>What computer should I bring?</h3>
            <p>You will need a computer with a keyboard that you can read and a mouse.
                Our youngest ninjas will also need to have flash installed for Lightbot and/or Scratch sessions.
                If you're not sure about it, follow this <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html">link</a> on the computer you will bring to CoderDojo and press the yellow button.
                We can help you with that at the beginning of CoderDojo session.
            </p>
            <h3>May I use a tablet/iPad?</h3>
            <p>Only very basic programming is possible using a tablet. You can find a lightbot or Scratch Junior in app stores. It is suitable for starting session for 6-7 year old, but later it is recommended to have a laptop.</p>

            <h3>May I use a Raspberry PI?</h3>
            <p>Using Raspberry PI could be done by teenagers working with text programming. In Liip, we don't have access to any external screens/keyboards, so you will need to bring it all with you. If you do that, you can learn with a Raspberry PI instead of a laptop.</p>

            <h3>Is there a break during CoderDojo?</h3>
            <p>Yes, there is! In the middle of each workshop we make a 10 minute break from the computers. You can then meet other ninjas, play fussball, see what others are doing,
                get some fresh air. Bring a snack and something to drink during the break.</p>

        <h2><a name="mentors"></a>Mentors</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>What experience should I have?</h3>
            <p>We base on online tools like Lightbot and Scratch. For more experienced ninjas, we have text based programming tools and tutorials.
                If you had any experience with programming, you should be good to join us as a mentor. You can check out and implement
                one or more games from our materials and see for yourself what problems our ninjas may face.</p>

            <h3>What language should I speak?</h3>
            <p>We speak all the languages! Our ninjas speak mostly German and English, so with at least one of them, you should be good.</p>

            <h3>How often may I participate?</h3>
            <p>You can come as often as you wish. The participation is voluntary. The CoderDojo takes place every Sunday and would not happen without our mentors.</p>

            <h3>Is there anything to prepare?</h3>
            <p>There is nothing that needs to be prepared on regular basis for CoderDojo. If you show up 10-15 minutes before the session, you can help with setting up the room.</p>

            <h3>How can I help?</h3>
            <p>Generally you can help with lots of things technical and non-technical:
                <ul>
                    <li>help ninjas design their games or follow their ideas, inspire their creativity</li>
                    <li>translate and improve existing learning materials</li>
                    <li>create new learning materials, courses </li>
                    <li>design flyers, posters, promotional materials</li>
                    <li>promote CoderDojo, bring new mentors and ninjas</li>
                    <li>help starting new CoderDojo (you don't have to be technical to start the CoderDojo!)</li>
                    <li>design and maintain our page</li>
                    <li>update FAQ</li>
                </ul>
                If you have some experience with programming, you can help with lightbot, scratch or lua (and other technologies).<br/>

            <h3>I am over 18, may I learn programming during CoderDojo?</h3>
            <p>CoderDojo is dedicated to ninjas between 7-17. If you would like to learn programming, you can have a look at some other
                meetups and groups that teach programming. One of my favourite places to learn is <a href="https://coursera.org">coursera.org</a> and there are many
                MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) available other than Coursera.</p>
